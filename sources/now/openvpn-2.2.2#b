Have a look in /usr/share/doc/#openvpn#/sample-config-files
for some more examples of how to configure OpenVPN.  You'll
need to add something to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local to start
OpenVPN, as well as to tell it where to find its config file.


See "man openvpn" and the other docs for more information.
