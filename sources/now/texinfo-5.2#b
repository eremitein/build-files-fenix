[i] The Info documentation system uses a plain text file to hold
its list of menu entries. The file is located at /usr/share/info/dir.
Unfortunately, due to occasional problems in the Makefiles of various
packages, it can sometimes get out of sync with the info pages installed
on the system. If the /usr/share/info/dir file ever needs to be recreated,
the following optional commands will accomplish the task:

pushd /usr/share/info
rm -fv dir
for f in *
  do install-info $f dir 2>/dev/null
done
popd
